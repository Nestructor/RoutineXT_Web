# RoutineXT_Web

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.0.

## Summary

The goal of this project is to develop a web application that helps the user to get fit by means of workouts carried out at home. The idea 
is that each week the user performs workout routines planned in their personalised timetable, so that they acquire a number of points as a 
reward for each routine performed. Likewise, if the user does not complete the routine, the accumulated points will be automatically subtracted. 
As the user's score increases, it will unlock challenges that will allow the user to increase their score very  easily. Similarly, the score 
will help the user to know how they are progressing or developing their physical fitness as in a gamification system.

## Development server (VSC)

Run `ng serve` to deploy the project.
